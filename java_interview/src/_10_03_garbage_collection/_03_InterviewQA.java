INTERVIEW Q&A: JAVA GARBAGE COLLECTION (BASIC -> INTERMEDIATE -> ADVANCED)

BASIC
1) What is Garbage Collection (GC)?
   - Automatic memory management that reclaims heap space of objects that are no longer reachable.

2) What makes an object eligible for GC?
   - When it is not reachable from any GC root.

3) What are GC Roots?
   - Examples:
     - Local variables on thread stacks
     - Active threads
     - Static fields of loaded classes
     - JNI references (native code)
     - System class loader and some JVM internal roots
     - Synchronization monitors
   - If an object can be reached by traversing references from a root, it is live.

4) Does Java use reference counting?
   - No. It uses reachability analysis. Hence cycles do not prevent collection.

5) Are circular references a problem?
   - No, as long as the cycle is unreachable from roots.

6) Heap vs Stack?
   - Heap: objects and arrays; managed by GC.
   - Stack: method frames, local variables, references; not managed by GC.

7) What is the Generational Hypothesis?
   - Most objects die young. Hence generational heaps (young/old) are efficient.

8) Young/Old generation basics
   - Young (Eden + Survivor S0/S1): high allocation rate, frequent minor GCs, cheap.
   - Old (Tenured): holds long-lived objects, collected less often (major/mixed/full collections).

9) What is Stop-The-World (STW)?
   - Phases where all application threads pause so the GC can do specific work (e.g., root scanning, remark).

10) What is finalize()?
   - A legacy hook called once before GC reclaims an object. Deprecated for removal since JDK 9. Unreliable and dangerous; do not use. Prefer AutoCloseable/Cleaner.

11) Difference between finalize and finally?
   - finally: language construct executed predictably at scope exit.
   - finalize: GC mechanism, non-deterministic, may never run.

12) How to request GC?
   - System.gc() / Runtime.getRuntime().gc(). Just a hint. JVM may ignore; some collectors may run a concurrent cycle instead (-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent for supported collectors).

13) Can you predict when GC runs?
   - No. It is non-deterministic and driven by allocation failure, heuristics, and configuration.

14) What gets garbage-collected?
   - Heap objects and arrays. Not directly: thread stacks, most native memory, file descriptors, sockets. Those need explicit close or Cleaners.

15) What is Metaspace?
   - Stores class metadata in native memory (replaced PermGen since Java 8). Tuned by -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize.

INTERMEDIATE
16) Minor vs Major vs Full GC
   - Minor: young generation only; fast, STW.
   - Major/Mixed (G1): includes old regions with young; STW parts.
   - Full: whole heap; often slow; try to avoid.

17) Promotion and Tenuring
   - Surviving objects move Eden -> Survivor -> Old.
   - Tuning knobs: -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold, -XX:TargetSurvivorRatio, -XX:SurvivorRatio.

18) TLAB (Thread-Local Allocation Buffer)
   - Each thread gets a small chunk for fast bump-the-pointer allocation. Reduces contention.

19) Common collectors
   - Serial: single-threaded, small heaps, embedded.
   - Parallel (Throughput): multi-threaded STW, good throughput.
   - G1 (default since JDK 9): region-based, predictable pauses, mixed collections, compacts incrementally.
   - ZGC: low-latency, concurrent relocation, colored pointers, generational since JDK 21.
   - Shenandoah: low-latency, concurrent compaction.

20) Soft/Weak/Phantom references
   - SoftReference: cache-like; cleared under memory pressure.
   - WeakReference: cleared eagerly when only weakly reachable; used by canonical maps/WeakHashMap keys.
   - PhantomReference: enqueued after object becomes phantom reachable (after finalization if any), used for post-mortem cleanup with ReferenceQueue. get() always returns null.

21) WeakHashMap vs HashMap
   - WeakHashMap holds weak keys; entries disappear when keys are only weakly reachable. Not for strong caches.

22) Memory leaks in Java?
   - Yes, when references are unintentionally retained:
     - Static caches/maps
     - Long-lived collections
     - Unremoved listeners/callbacks
     - ThreadLocal values not removed in thread pools
     - ClassLoader leaks (e.g., from static singletons, ThreadLocals)
     - Unclosed resources preventing buffers/native memory reclamation

23) Class unloading
   - A class can be unloaded when its ClassLoader is unreachable and no live classes from it remain loaded. Often relevant in plugin/containers.

24) OutOfMemoryError types
   - Java heap space
   - GC overhead limit exceeded
   - Metaspace
   - Direct buffer memory
   - Unable to create new native thread
   - Requesting too big array/string

25) Direct memory and GC
   - off-heap DirectByteBuffer uses Cleaner to free memory. Still need to release references or close your wrapping resource; otherwise off-heap memory can be retained.

26) Tools to diagnose GC/memory
   - jcmd, jmap, jstat, jconsole, jvisualvm, Java Flight Recorder/Java Mission Control, Eclipse MAT, async-profiler (alloc), GC logs.

27) GC logging (examples)
   - -Xlog:gc* (JDK 9+) or -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -Xloggc:gc.log (pre-9)
   - -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=...

28) Containerized environments
   - JVM respects cgroup limits:
     - -XX:InitialRAMPercentage, -XX:MaxRAMPercentage, -XX:MinRAMPercentage
     - -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize
     - -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize
   - Choose collector per latency/throughput goals.

ADVANCED
29) Barriers and remembered sets
   - Write barriers mark card tables or update remembered sets so young collections can avoid scanning the entire old gen.
   - G1 uses remembered sets per region (card-based) and SATB (snapshot-at-the-beginning) for concurrent marking.

30) SATB vs incremental update
   - SATB records the old value at write time during marking. Used by G1 and Shenandoah to achieve concurrent marking correctness.

31) Humongous objects (G1)
   - Very large objects (relative to region size) occupy contiguous regions specially; can cause more full GCs if abused.

32) ZGC/Shenandoah basics
   - Region-based, concurrent relocation to avoid long pauses.
   - ZGC uses colored pointers and load barriers; Shenandoah uses Brooks pointers and barriers.
   - Generational ZGC (JDK 21+) reduces remembered set pressure and improves throughput.

33) Safepoints
   - Points where threads can be stopped for GC or deoptimization. Excess safepoint polls can impact performance.

34) Finalization pitfalls
   - Non-deterministic, can resurrect objects, runs on a single thread, backlogs, performance hazards. Prefer AutoCloseable/Cleaner.

35) Tuning strategy
   - Start with defaults (G1). Measure.
   - Define SLOs: max pause (p99), throughput, footprint.
   - If pauses too long, consider ZGC/Shenandoah.
   - Reduce allocation rate/object churn (avoid intermed collections, use pooling only when proven).
   - Right-size heap to reduce frequency of GCs but beware of long full GCs on very large heaps (choose low-latency collectors).

36) Common interview gotchas
   - Static reference prevents GC.
   - Setting to null may help earlier collection but JITâ€™s liveness analysis often makes it unnecessary.
   - System.gc() is a hint; can hurt performance.
   - Circular references do not leak by themselves.
   - WeakHashMap only weakens keys, not values.
   - SoftReference is not a strong cache guarantee.
   - finalize can run at most once; object may revive itself (bad practice).
   - Class unloading requires the loader to be unreachable.

CHEATSHEET: USEFUL FLAGS (VERIFY FOR YOUR JDK)

- Collector selection
  -XX:+UseG1GC (default since JDK 9)
  -XX:+UseZGC
  -XX:+UseShenandoahGC
  -XX:+UseSerialGC
  -XX:+UseParallelGC
- Logging (JDK 9+)
  -Xlog:gc*,safepoint:file=gc.log:tags,uptime,level,timestamps
- Diagnostics
  -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=heap.hprof
  -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m
  -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512m
- G1 knobs (only if you must)
  -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200
  -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=45
  -XX:NewRatio=2 or -XX:MaxNewSize / -XX:NewSize (prefer to let ergonomics decide)

/*
CODING Q&A QUICK EXAMPLES

Q: Show that circular references are collectable in Java.
A: Create two objects referencing each other; drop all external references; run a GC; both are eligible because no path from GC roots exists.

Q: Implement a simple cache with SoftReference.
A: Keep SoftReference<T> to cached values. On get, if ref.get() is null, recompute and replace. Beware soft refs are cleared under pressure; do not rely for correctness.

Q: When would you prefer WeakReference?
A: To allow canonicalized objects to be reclaimed when not in active use (e.g., interning maps) or to avoid memory leaks by keys (WeakHashMap). Remember values remain strong unless also wrapped.

Q: How do you release off-heap resources?
A: Use try-with-resources and AutoCloseable. For safety nets, use Cleaner to schedule cleanup if user forgets to close. Avoid finalize().

Q: How does GC interact with ClassLoaders?
A: A ClassLoader and its classes can be unloaded when the loader is unreachable and no classes from it are in use. Prevent common leaks by not storing loader-specific objects in static singletons or ThreadLocals of system threads.

Q: How to diagnose memory leak?
A:
- Enable heap dump on OOME; analyze with MAT.
- Take periodic heap dumps (jcmd GC.heap_dump).
- Inspect dominator tree and retained sizes to find GC root paths.
- Examine GC logs for frequent full GCs or promotion failures.
- Use JFR or async-profiler (alloc) to find allocation hot spots.

Q: What causes "GC overhead limit exceeded"?
A: JVM spent too much time (default ~98%) doing GC but recovered very little memory (default <2%). Usually a severe memory pressure/leak. Increase heap or fix leaks.

Q: Major differences among collectors?
A:
- Parallel: best throughput, higher pauses.
- G1: balanced, predictable pauses, default since JDK 9.
- ZGC/Shenandoah: very low pauses, slightly lower throughput and higher CPU/footprint; great for large heaps and latency-sensitive services.

Q: How to avoid long pauses?
A:
- Choose ZGC/Shenandoah or tune G1 pause targets.
- Reduce allocation rate and large object churn.
- Avoid humongous allocations (especially in G1).
- Keep live set small by clearing caches, using bounded structures.

Q: What are humongous objects and why care?
A: In region-based collectors, very large objects are handled specially and can cause fragmentation/longer pauses. Split data structures or use off-heap if appropriate.

Q: How do SoftReference and WeakReference differ in GC timing?
A:
- Weak: cleared eagerly as soon as no strong refs remain.
- Soft: retained until memory pressure forces clearing; helpful for caches but not deterministic.

Q: Is setting references to null helpful?
A:
- Sometimes, if the variable would otherwise stay live for a long scope (e.g., large arrays in long methods). The JIT often performs liveness analysis, so explicit nulling is rarely necessary. Prefer smaller scopes.

Q: Can GC collect a static fieldâ€™s object?
A:
- Not while the class is loaded and the static field holds a reference. Clear static refs when no longer needed.

Q: What triggers class unloading?
A:
- During GC, if the ClassLoader is unreachable and no classes it defined are reachable.

Q: How to read GC logs at a glance?
A:
- Look for: frequency of collections, pause durations, promotion failures, concurrent cycle times, heap occupancy before/after, allocation rates. Continuous full GCs indicate severe pressure or fragmentation.

VERSION NOTES
- Default GC is G1 since JDK 9.
- PermGen removed in Java 8; replaced by Metaspace (native).
- ZGC became production in JDK 15; generational ZGC in JDK 21.
- CMS removed in JDK 14.
- finalize() deprecated for removal since JDK 9; avoid its use.

FURTHER PRACTICE
- Build a small LRU cache and compare behavior with SoftReference-based cache under memory pressure.
- Use JFR to measure allocation hotspots and GC pause distribution.
- Experiment with -Xms/-Xmx, -XX:+UseG1GC vs -XX:+UseZGC, and -Xlog:gc* on a sample workload.
