/**
 * Thread Lifecycle & Runnable - Theory + Live Demonstrations
 *
 * Concepts covered in comments and code:
 * - Runnable (task) vs Thread (carrier). Prefer Runnable/Callable for separation of concerns.
 * - start() vs run(): start() creates a new thread; run() executes in current thread.
 * - Thread states: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED.
 * - Typical transitions and how to reproduce each state safely.
 * - join(), sleep(), wait()/notify(), synchronized monitor/lock.
 * - Interrupts and how blocking methods react to interrupt.
 * - Daemon vs user threads.
 * - Naming, identity, priority (touch on in comments).
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Thread.getState() is a snapshot and can change quickly.
 * - Scheduling is OS/JVM dependent; small timing differences are normal.
 * - Monitors (synchronized) provide mutual exclusion and memory visibility (happens-before).
 * - wait() must be called while holding the same monitor; notify/notifyAll also require it.
 * - InterruptedException clears the threadâ€™s interrupt status; re-set if you need to propagate it.

/*
Additional notes (theory quick reference):

- Thread identity:
  - getName(), setName(), getId(), isAlive(), isDaemon(), getPriority()/setPriority().
  - Priority is a hint to the scheduler, not a guarantee.

- States recap:
  - NEW: created, not started.
  - RUNNABLE: executing or ready-to-run.
  - BLOCKED: waiting to acquire a monitor (synchronized).
  - WAITING: waiting indefinitely (Object.wait(), Thread.join()).
  - TIMED_WAITING: waiting with timeout (sleep, wait(timeout), join(timeout)).
  - TERMINATED: finished run().

- Synchronization and visibility:
  - synchronized provides mutual exclusion and happens-before on lock release/acquire.
  - volatile ensures visibility and ordering for a single variable.
  - Avoid calling wait()/notify() without owning the monitor.

- start() vs run():
  - start() -> new thread -> calls run().
  - run() -> normal method call in current thread.

- Interrupts:
  - interrupt() sets the flag.
  - Blocking calls respond with InterruptedException and clear the flag.
  - If you catch it and want to propagate cancellation, re-set the flag.

- Runnable vs Callable:
  - Runnable: no return, no checked exception.
  - Callable<V>: returns V, can throw checked exceptions (used with ExecutorService).

- Prefer using ExecutorService (thread pools) for production code; manual Thread is fine for learning/demonstrations.
